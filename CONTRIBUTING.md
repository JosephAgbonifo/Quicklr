# 🤝 Contributing to Quirklr

Hey there! 👋 Thanks for showing interest in contributing to **Quirklr** — we’re stoked to have you here!

Whether you're here to squash bugs, drop hot new features, or help us keep things clean and crisp — you're officially awesome. 🧠⚡✨

## 🚧 Ground Rules

- **All contributions must be made to the `development` branch.**  
  **Never** open pull requests directly on `main`.
- Be **respectful**, **inclusive**, and **constructive** — we’re building a space where everyone can thrive.
- Keep your code **clean and readable**. If it’s not self-explanatory, drop a comment like a good teammate.
- If you're working on something **big**, open an issue first so we can vibe-check the direction together.
- UI tweaks, accessibility improvements, and documentation updates are **just as valuable** as new features!
