# 🚀 Quirklr

**Quirklr** is a spontaneous study session web app designed for students who thrive in fast, focused, and collaborative learning environments. No more awkward DMs or ghosted group chats — just instant study sessions with fellow learners when you need them most.

---

## 🧠 The Vision

We're on a mission to make studying **social**, **spontaneous**, and **satisfying**. Quirklr turns “I’ll start later” into “Let’s start now.”
